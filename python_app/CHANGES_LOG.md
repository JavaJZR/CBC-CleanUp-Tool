# Processing Controller Updates - Full Name and Resignation Date Lookup

## Date: October 25, 2025

### Changes Made

#### 1. `get_full_name_from_pernr()` Method (Lines 211-275)

**Improvement**: Enhanced full name lookup when PERNR is found from previous reference

**Changes**:
- **Prioritize "Fullname" column** in resigned employee list (exact match first)
- **Fallback to "Full Name"** as alternative (exact match second)
- **Then flexible matching** for other name-related columns (case-insensitive)
- **Added validation** to only return non-empty full name values from resigned list

**Search Priority in Resigned List**:
1. Exact match: "Fullname"
2. Exact match: "Full Name"
3. Flexible match: Any column containing "name" (case-insensitive)

**Logic Flow**:
```
If PERNR not found in current masterlist:
  ├─ Look in resigned masterlist
  └─ If found:
      ├─ Search for "Fullname" column
      ├─ If not found, search for "Full Name"
      ├─ If not found, use flexible name matching
      └─ Only return if value is not empty/null
```

#### 2. `get_resignation_date()` Method (Lines 277-333)

**Improvement**: Enhanced resignation date lookup with column priority

**Changes**:
- **Prioritize "Effectivity from HR Separation Report"** column (exact match, case-insensitive)
- **Fallback to columns** containing both "effectivity" AND "separation"
- **Then fallback** to generic date-related columns

**Search Priority for Resignation Date Column**:
1. "Effectivity from HR Separation Report" (case-insensitive exact match)
2. Columns with both "effectivity" AND "separation" in name
3. Generic columns: resignation, date, end, termination, exit, effectivity, separation, report

**Logic Flow**:
```
If PERNR found in resigned masterlist:
  ├─ Search for "Effectivity from HR Separation Report" column
  ├─ If not found, search for columns with "effectivity" + "separation"
  ├─ If not found, search for generic date columns
  └─ If found:
      └─ Parse and format date as MM/DD/YYYY
```

#### 3. **NEW**: Full Name Source Tracking (Lines 58, 100-109, 113-115, 415)

**Improvement**: Added "Full Name Source" column to track data origin

**Changes**:
- **New column**: "Full Name Source" added to all output datasets
- **Tracks source** of full name retrieval for every employee record
- **Values**: "Current Masterlist" or "Resigned Masterlist" (or None if not found)

**When is Full Name Source Set?**:
1. **During name matching** (Step 2):
   - If found in Current Masterlist → Source = "Current Masterlist"
   - If found in Resigned Masterlist → Source = "Resigned Masterlist"

2. **During PERNR-based lookup** (Step 3):
   - If PERNR found but name missing, retrieve from masterlists
   - Source is set based on which masterlist had the match

**Data Flow**:
```
get_full_name_from_pernr() returns: (full_name, source)
- "Current Masterlist" if found in current
- "Resigned Masterlist" if found in resigned
- None, None if not found anywhere
```

### Why These Changes?

1. **Better Column Detection**: Explicitly prioritizes the most relevant columns first before falling back to flexible matching
2. **Data Accuracy**: Ensures the correct data source is used (Fullname vs Full Name, specific HR report column)
3. **Robustness**: Maintains fallback options for different data formats
4. **Data Lineage**: "Full Name Source" column provides transparency about data origin
5. **Consistency**: Works for all users, regardless of whether full name is from current or resigned masterlist

### Output Columns

The cleaned report now includes:
- `PERNR` - Employee number
- `Full Name (From Masterlist)` - Retrieved full name
- **`Full Name Source`** - NEW: Where the full name came from
- `Resignation Date` - From resigned masterlist
- `Position Name` - Organizational data
- `Segment Name` - Organizational data
- `Group Name` - Organizational data
- `Area/Division Name` - Organizational data
- `Department/Branch` - Organizational data
- `Match Type` - How the record was matched
- `Match Score` - Match quality score

### Testing Recommendations

1. Test with files containing "Fullname" column in resigned list
2. Test with files containing "Effectivity from HR Separation Report" column
3. Test with files using alternative column names to verify fallback logic
4. Verify that empty/null full names are properly handled
5. Verify date formatting is correct (MM/DD/YYYY)
6. **NEW**: Verify "Full Name Source" column correctly shows data origin
7. **NEW**: Check that source is populated for both name matching and PERNR lookups
