# Clear System Reports Feature

## Overview

Added a new button to clear only the system report files (Current System Report and Previous Reference) while keeping the masterlist files loaded. This is useful for users who want to process new system reports with the same masterlist references.

## Implementation Date
January 2025

## What Was Added

### 1. New UI Button: "🗑️ Clear System Reports"
- Located next to the "Clear All Files" button
- Orange color (#f59e0b) to distinguish from "Clear All Files" (gray)
- Clear visual separation between the two clear options

### 2. Functionality

**Clear System Reports Button:**
- Clears: Current System Report and Previous Reference
- Keeps: Masterlist – Current and Masterlist – Resigned
- Use case: Upload new system reports for processing while keeping reference masterlists

**Clear All Files Button:**
- Clears: All files including masterlists
- Resets: Entire application state
- Use case: Start fresh or clear everything including masterlists

## Files Modified

### 1. `python_app/views/file_upload_view.py`
- Added `clear_system_reports()` method
- Added `reset_system_report_cards()` method
- Updated `create_clear_all_button()` to include both buttons
- Updated confirmation message for "Clear All Files" to mention masterlists

### 2. `python_app/controllers/main_controller.py`
- Added `clear_system_reports()` method
- Handles clearing only system report data
- Updates UI to reset only system report cards
- Shows appropriate success message

### 3. `python_app/models/employee_data.py`
- Added `clear_system_reports()` method
- Clears only `current_system` and `previous_reference` data
- Keeps `masterlist_current` and `masterlist_resigned` intact
- Resets processed data (cleaned_data, unmatched_data, fuzzy_matched_data)

## User Experience

### Before
```
[🗑️ Clear All Files] ← Only option to clear files
```

### After
```
[🗑️ Clear System Reports] [🗑️ Clear All Files]
```

### Workflow Example

**Scenario**: User has processed October data and wants to process November data with the same masterlists.

**Before:**
1. Upload masterlists again (even though they haven't changed)
2. Upload new system reports
3. Process

**After:**
1. Click "🗑️ Clear System Reports"
2. Upload new Current System Report
3. Upload new Previous Reference (if changed)
4. Process (masterlists already loaded!)

## Benefits

✅ **More Efficient**: Don't need to re-upload unchanged masterlists  
✅ **Clearer Intent**: Separate buttons for different clear actions  
✅ **Better UX**: Users understand what each button does  
✅ **Time Savings**: Skip uploading masterlists for new processing sessions  
✅ **Flexibility**: Can still clear everything with "Clear All Files"  

## Technical Details

### Button Layout
```python
clear_button_frame:
  ├─ Clear System Reports (orange) - Clears only system reports
  └─ Clear All Files (gray) - Clears everything
```

### Data Clearing Logic
```python
def clear_system_reports(self):
    # Clear system report data
    self.current_system = None
    self.previous_reference = None
    
    # Clear processed data
    self.cleaned_data = None
    self.unmatched_data = None
    self.fuzzy_matched_data = None
    
    # Clear file paths for system reports only
    self.file_paths['current_system'] = None
    self.file_paths['previous_reference'] = None
    
    # Keep masterlists intact!
```

## Summary

This feature improves the workflow for users who regularly process multiple system reports with the same masterlist references. It provides a clear distinction between clearing data files versus clearing reference files, making the application more intuitive and efficient.

**Status**: ✅ Complete and Production Ready
