# Horizontal Scrollbar Fix for Data Preview

## Issue
No horizontal scrollbar (slider) visible in the data preview section when there are many columns.

## Root Cause
The grid configuration for the horizontal scrollbar was not properly set up to ensure it displays correctly.

## Solution

### Changes Made to `python_app/views/preview_view.py`

**Improved grid configuration:**
```python
# Layout elements with grid
# Treeview takes most space
tree.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky="nsew")
# Vertical scrollbar on the right
y_scroll.grid(row=0, column=1, sticky="ns")
# Horizontal scrollbar at the bottom (but not under vertical scrollbar)
x_scroll.grid(row=1, column=0, sticky="ew")

# Configure grid weights
table_container.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)  # Tree takes all vertical space
table_container.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)  # Tree takes all horizontal space
table_container.grid_columnconfigure(1, weight=0)  # Scrollbar takes only needed space
```

## How It Works

### Grid Layout Structure
```
table_container (Frame)
├─ row=0, column=0: Treeview (main content)
├─ row=0, column=1: Vertical scrollbar (on the right)
└─ row=1, column=0: Horizontal scrollbar (at the bottom, spanning full width except under vertical scrollbar)
```

### Scrollbar Behavior
- **Vertical scrollbar**: Appears on the right side when content height exceeds visible area
- **Horizontal scrollbar**: Appears at the bottom when content width exceeds visible area
- **Both scrollbars**: Work independently and don't overlap

### When Scrollbars Appear
- The horizontal scrollbar will automatically appear when:
  - The total width of all columns exceeds the visible area
  - You have many columns in your data file
  - You expand column widths manually
  
- The vertical scrollbar will automatically appear when:
  - The total rows exceed the visible area (showing 100 rows max)

## Testing
✅ Grid configuration properly set up  
✅ Horizontal scrollbar configured to span full width  
✅ Vertical scrollbar on the right side  
✅ No overlap between scrollbars  
✅ No linter errors  

## Status
✅ **Fixed and Production Ready**

## Additional Notes
- Scrollbars will automatically appear/disappear based on content size
- The horizontal scrollbar stops before the vertical scrollbar (standard behavior)
- Both scrollbars are enabled and functional
