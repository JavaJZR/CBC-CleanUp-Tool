# Masterlist Cross-Session Persistence - Implementation Guide

## Feature: Persistent Masterlist Files Across Application Sessions

### Date: October 25, 2025
### Status: âœ… COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Masterlist files now **persist across application sessions**. When you upload a masterlist once, it will be remembered even after closing and reopening the application. The system automatically:

- âœ… Saves masterlist file paths to a config file
- âœ… Loads masterlist paths when application starts
- âœ… Shows which masterlist files are currently loaded
- âœ… Allows updating masterlists when needed

---

## How It Works

### Configuration File

The system creates a config file: `python_app/masterlist_config.json`

This file stores the file paths of uploaded masterlists:
```json
{
  "masterlist_current": "C:/Users/Jared/Documents/masterlist_current_2025.xlsx",
  "masterlist_resigned": "C:/Users/Jared/Documents/masterlist_resigned_2025.xlsx"
}
```

### File Path Storage

**What Gets Saved:**
- Full file path to the masterlist file
- Only masterlist paths (Current and Resigned)
- Paths persist until overwritten

**What Doesn't Get Saved:**
- Current System Report paths
- Previous Reference paths
- Actual file data (only path references)

---

## User Experience

### First Time Setup

1. **Upload Masterlists**:
   - Click "ðŸ”„ Update" on Masterlist â€“ Current
   - Select your masterlist file
   - Click "ðŸ”„ Update" on Masterlist â€“ Resigned
   - Select your masterlist file

2. **Config File Created**:
   - System creates `masterlist_config.json`
   - File paths are saved

3. **Run Cleanup**:
   - Upload Current System Report
   - Run cleanup as normal

### Subsequent Sessions

**When You Reopen the Application:**

1. **Automatic Load**:
   - System reads `masterlist_config.json`
   - Loads masterlist file paths
   - Displays file names in UI

2. **File Display**:
   ```
   Masterlist â€“ Current: [ðŸ”„ Update]
   âœ“ masterlist_current_2025.xlsx
   (5,200 rows, 20 columns)
   
   Masterlist â€“ Resigned: [ðŸ”„ Update]
   âœ“ masterlist_resigned_2025.xlsx
   (1,800 rows, 18 columns)
   ```

3. **Ready to Use**:
   - Just upload Current System Report
   - Run cleanup immediately
   - No need to re-upload masterlists!

### Updating Masterlists

**When Masterlists Change:**

1. **Click Update Button**:
   - Click "ðŸ”„ Update" on the masterlist to update
   - Select new masterlist file

2. **Automatic Save**:
   - New path is saved to config file
   - Old path is overwritten

3. **Continue Using**:
   - New masterlist is now saved
   - Will persist for future sessions

## Technical Implementation

### New Methods in `EmployeeDataset`

#### `_load_masterlist_paths()`
Loads persisted paths from config file on initialization:
```python
def _load_masterlist_paths(self):
    if self.CONFIG_FILE.exists():
        # Read config file
        # Restore masterlist paths if files still exist
```

#### `_save_masterlist_paths()`
Saves current masterlist paths to config file:
```python
def _save_masterlist_paths(self):
    config = {
        'masterlist_current': self.file_paths.get('masterlist_current'),
        'masterlist_resigned': self.file_paths.get('masterlist_resigned')
    }
    # Write to config file
```

#### `save_masterlist_path(file_type, file_path)`
Public method to save a masterlist path:
```python
def save_masterlist_path(self, file_type: str, file_path: str):
    if file_type in ['masterlist_current', 'masterlist_resigned']:
        self.file_paths[file_type] = file_path
        self._save_masterlist_paths()
```

#### `get_persisted_masterlist_path(file_type)`
Retrieve persisted path if file exists:
```python
def get_persisted_masterlist_path(self, file_type: str) -> Optional[str]:
    path = self.file_paths.get(file_type)
    if path and os.path.exists(path):
        return path
    return None
```

### Modified `FileController.store_file_data()`

Added persistence call when storing masterlist files:
```python
# Persist masterlist paths for cross-session use
if file_type in ['masterlist_current', 'masterlist_resigned']:
    dataset.save_masterlist_path(file_type, file_path)
```

---

## File Location

**Config File**: `python_app/masterlist_config.json`

This file is created automatically in the application directory when masterlists are first uploaded.

**Example Content**:
```json
{
  "masterlist_current": "C:/Users/Jared/Documents/masterlist_current_2025.xlsx",
  "masterlist_resigned": "C:/Users/Jared/Documents/masterlist_resigned_2025.xlsx"
}
```

---

## When Paths Are Cleared

**Paths are removed when:**
- User clicks "Clear All Files" button
- Config file is manually deleted
- Application is uninstalled

**Paths persist through:**
- Application restarts
- Computer restarts
- Multiple sessions
- Until explicitly updated

---

## Error Handling

### Missing Files

If a saved masterlist file no longer exists:
- Path is ignored
- User can upload a new file
- No error thrown

### Corrupted Config File

If config file is corrupted:
- Ignored gracefully
- Application continues normally
- User can re-upload masterlists

### Permission Issues

If unable to write config file:
- Application continues without persistence
- No error shown to user
- Functionality unaffected

---

## Benefits

âœ… **True Persistence**
- Masterlists remain across sessions
- No need to re-upload repeatedly
- Faster workflow for regular users

âœ… **Automatic Management**
- No manual configuration needed
- Config file created automatically
- Transparent to user

âœ… **Safe & Reliable**
- Only stores file paths (not data)
- Validates file existence
- Handles errors gracefully

âœ… **Flexible**
- Easy to update masterlists
- Easy to clear persistence
- Works with any file location

## Testing Scenarios

- [ ] Upload masterlists â†’ Close app â†’ Reopen â†’ Masterlists still loaded
- [ ] Upload masterlists â†’ Check config file created
- [ ] Reopen app â†’ See persisted masterlist file names
- [ ] Update masterlist â†’ New path saved
- [ ] Delete config file â†’ Paths cleared
- [ ] Move masterlist file â†’ Path invalidated gracefully
- [ ] Clear All Files â†’ Config file cleared
- [ ] Multiple sessions â†’ Masterlists persist throughout

---

## User Workflow Example

### Session 1
```
1. Open application
2. Upload Masterlist â€“ Current â†’ Saved to config
3. Upload Masterlist â€“ Resigned â†’ Saved to config
4. Upload Current System Report
5. Run cleanup
6. Close application
```

### Session 2 (Next Day)
```
1. Open application
2. See: "âœ“ masterlist_current_2025.xlsx (already loaded)"
3. See: "âœ“ masterlist_resigned_2025.xlsx (already loaded)"
4. Upload NEW Current System Report
5. Run cleanup immediately
6. No need to upload masterlists!
```

### Session 3 (Month Later - Update Masterlist)
```
1. Open application
2. See old masterlist names
3. Click "ðŸ”„ Update" on Masterlist â€“ Current
4. Upload new version â†’ New path saved
5. Upload Current System Report
6. Run cleanup
```

---

## Summary

**Before:**
- Had to upload masterlists every session
- No persistence across sessions
- Tedious for regular users

**After:**
- Upload masterlists once
- Automatically loaded on startup
- True cross-session persistence
- Saves time and improves workflow

**How It Works:**
1. Upload masterlist â†’ Path saved to config file
2. Close app â†’ Config file persists
3. Reopen app â†’ Paths loaded automatically
4. Use masterlists â†’ No re-upload needed!
