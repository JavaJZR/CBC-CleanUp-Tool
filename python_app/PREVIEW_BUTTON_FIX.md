# Preview Button Fix for Saved Masterlists

## Issue
Preview buttons for automatically loaded masterlist files were not working.

## Root Cause
The `preview_file` method in the main controller had a check `if self.current_step >= 2` that prevented the preview section from showing when the app started with step 1. Additionally, the method wasn't using the `file_type` parameter to select the specific file in the preview.

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. `python_app/controllers/main_controller.py`
**Fixed `preview_file` method:**
```python
def preview_file(self, file_type: str):
    """Preview a specific file"""
    # Always show preview section when preview is requested
    self.main_window.show_preview_section()
    
    # Select the specific file in the preview
    if self.main_window.preview_view:
        self.main_window.preview_view.select_file_for_preview(file_type)
```

**What changed:**
- Removed the `if self.current_step >= 2` check
- Added logic to select the specific file in the preview
- Now properly uses the `file_type` parameter

#### 2. `python_app/views/preview_view.py`
**Added `select_file_for_preview` method:**
```python
def select_file_for_preview(self, file_type: str):
    """Select a specific file for preview"""
    file_names = {
        'current_system': 'Current System Report',
        'previous_reference': 'Previous Reference',
        'masterlist_current': 'Masterlist – Current',
        'masterlist_resigned': 'Masterlist – Resigned'
    }
    
    display_name = file_names.get(file_type)
    if display_name and self.preview_selector:
        # Set the combobox value to the selected file
        self.preview_selector.set(display_name)
        # Update the preview to show the selected file
        self.update_preview()
```

**What changed:**
- New method to select a specific file when preview button is clicked
- Maps file type to display name
- Sets the preview selector to the selected file
- Updates the preview display

## How It Works Now

### Flow When Preview Button is Clicked

1. **User clicks preview button** on a file card
2. **File type is passed** to `preview_file(file_type)` 
3. **Preview section is shown** (no longer blocked by step check)
4. **Specific file is selected** in the preview dropdown
5. **Preview displays** the correct file's data

### For Auto-Loaded Masterlists

1. **App starts** and loads persisted masterlists
2. **UI cards are updated** with file info and preview buttons enabled
3. **User clicks preview** button on masterlist card
4. **Preview section opens** showing the selected masterlist file
5. **Data is displayed** correctly

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Preview buttons work for manually uploaded files
- ✅ Preview buttons work for auto-loaded masterlists
- ✅ Preview section shows correct file when button is clicked
- ✅ Preview works regardless of current step
- ✅ No linter errors introduced

## Status
✅ **Fixed and Production Ready**
