# Quick Reference - Full Name Source Tracking

## 🎯 What's New?

New column: **"Full Name Source"** - Tells you where each employee's full name came from

## 📊 Column Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Current Masterlist` | Name was found in active employees masterlist |
| `Resigned Masterlist` | Name was found in resigned employees masterlist |
| *(empty/None)* | Name could not be found in any masterlist |

## 🔍 How It Works

### Scenario 1: Name Found During Matching
```
Employee Record
    ↓
Try matching name in Current Masterlist
    ├─ ✓ Found → Full Name Source = "Current Masterlist"
    ├─ ✗ Not Found → Try Resigned Masterlist
    │   ├─ ✓ Found → Full Name Source = "Resigned Masterlist"
    │   └─ ✗ Not Found → Continue to PERNR lookup
```

### Scenario 2: Name Retrieved via PERNR
```
Employee Record has PERNR but no name
    ↓
Lookup by PERNR in Current Masterlist
    ├─ ✓ Found → Full Name Source = "Current Masterlist"
    ├─ ✗ Not Found → Try Resigned Masterlist
    │   ├─ ✓ Found → Full Name Source = "Resigned Masterlist"
    │   └─ ✗ Not Found → Full Name Source = (empty)
```

## 📋 Example Data

| Employee ID | PERNR | Full Name | Full Name Source |
|-------------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| EMP001 | 1001 | John Smith | Current Masterlist |
| EMP002 | 2002 | Jane Doe | Resigned Masterlist |
| EMP003 | 3003 | *(empty)* | *(empty)* |
| EMP004 | 4004 | Robert Johnson | Resigned Masterlist |

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. Verify Data Quality
- Check if names came from expected source
- Identify employees in resigned list (might need follow-up)

### 2. Audit Trail
- Track which data sources were used
- Comply with data governance requirements

### 3. Troubleshooting
- When names look incorrect, see which list they came from
- Helps identify data sync issues

### 4. Reporting
- Generate statistics: "X% from current, Y% from resigned, Z% not found"
- Identify employees needing manual review

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

**File Changed**: `python_app/controllers/processing_controller.py`

**Key Methods Updated**:
1. `initialize_new_columns()` - Added new column
2. `get_full_name_from_pernr()` - Returns (name, source) tuple
3. `cleanup_worker()` - Tracks source during processing
4. `update_employee_record()` - Stores source in output

**Imports**: Added `Tuple` from typing module
